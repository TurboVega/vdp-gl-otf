/**
* @brief Represents the VGA 8 colors bitmapped controller
*
* This VGA controller allows just 8 colors, but requires less (8/3) RAM than VGAController, at the same resolution. Each pixel is represented
* by 3 bits, which is an index to a palette of 8 colors. Every 3 bytes of the frame buffer there are 8 pixels.
* For example, a frame buffer of 640x480 requires about 113K of RAM.
*
* VGA8Controller output is very CPU intensive process and consumes up to 23% of one CPU core (measured at 640x480x60Hz). Anyway this allows to have
* more RAM free for your application.
*
*
* This example initializes VGA Controller with 64 colors (16 visible at the same time) at 640x480:
*
*     fabgl::VGA8Controller displayController;
*     // the default assigns GPIO22 and GPIO21 to Red, GPIO19 and GPIO18 to Green, GPIO5 and GPIO4 to Blue, GPIO23 to HSync and GPIO15 to VSync
*     displayController.begin();
*     displayController.setResolution(VGA_640x480_60Hz);
